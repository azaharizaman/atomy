# Nexus\PaymentGateway Implementation Summary

**Package:** `nexus/payment-gateway`  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Status:** � Core Complete  
**Last Updated:** March 11, 2026

---

## Overview

The PaymentGateway package provides a unified, provider-agnostic interface for payment gateway integrations. It extends the core Nexus\Payment package with multi-gateway support, tokenization, and webhook processing.

---

## March 2026 Hardening Update

- Hardened webhook verification flow by extending `WebhookHandlerInterface::verifySignature(...)` to accept request headers and passing headers from `WebhookProcessor`.
- Replaced Stripe verification placeholder with real signature validation:
  - Parses `Stripe-Signature` (`t=...`, `v1=...`)
  - Validates timestamp replay window
  - Verifies HMAC in constant time
- Implemented Adyen HMAC verification using canonical `NotificationRequestItem` signing string and constant-time compare.
- Removed synthetic/random event ID behavior in hardened handlers:
  - Stripe now requires a provider event ID
  - Adyen now generates deterministic event IDs for stable deduplication
- Corrected webhook event-type enum mappings to valid `WebhookEventType` cases.
- Added targeted unit test coverage:
  - `tests/Unit/Webhooks/StripeWebhookHandlerTest.php`
  - `tests/Unit/Webhooks/AdyenWebhookHandlerTest.php`
  - Updated `tests/Unit/Services/WebhookProcessorTest.php` for header forwarding verification

## Gateway Implementations

| Gateway | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Stripe | 🔴 Planned | P0 | Recommended first implementation |
| PayPal | 🔴 Planned | P1 | |
| Square | 🔴 Planned | P2 | |
| Adyen | 🔴 Planned | P2 | |
| Braintree | 🔴 Planned | P3 | |

> **Note:** Concrete gateway implementations should be created as separate packages (e.g., `nexus/payment-gateway-stripe`) following the progressive disclosure pattern.

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Extension Package Pattern

This package extends `Nexus\Payment` without modifying it, following the progressive disclosure pattern documented in ARCHITECTURE.md.

### 2. Provider-Agnostic Design

All gateway-specific logic is encapsulated behind `GatewayInterface`, allowing seamless provider switching.

### 3. Secure Token Management

- Tokens are immutable value objects
- Credentials use sensitive data masking
- Token storage is abstracted for flexibility

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture

All operations emit events for:
- Audit logging
- Async processing
- System integration

### 5. Idempotency Support

Built-in idempotency management prevents duplicate transactions during retries.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Authorization

```php
use Nexus\PaymentGateway\Services\GatewayManager;
use Nexus\PaymentGateway\DTOs\AuthorizeRequest;
use Nexus\PaymentGateway\Enums\GatewayProvider;
use Nexus\Common\ValueObjects\Money;

$result = $gatewayManager->authorize(
    provider: GatewayProvider::STRIPE,
    request: new AuthorizeRequest(
        amount: Money::of(10000, 'USD'),
        currency: 'USD',
        paymentMethod: 'tok_visa',
        transactionReference: 'order-123',
        description: 'Order #123',
    ),
);

if ($result->isSuccess) {
    echo "Authorized: " . $result->gatewayTransactionId;
}
```

### Tokenization

```php
use Nexus\PaymentGateway\Services\TokenVault;
use Nexus\PaymentGateway\DTOs\TokenizationRequest;

$storageId = $tokenVault->tokenizeAndStore(
    customerId: 'cust-123',
    request: new TokenizationRequest(
        cardNumber: '4242424242424242',
        expiryMonth: 12,
        expiryYear: 2025,
        cvv: '123',
        cardholderName: 'John Doe',
    ),
    provider: GatewayProvider::STRIPE,
);
```

### Webhook Processing

```php
use Nexus\PaymentGateway\Services\WebhookProcessor;

$processor->setSecret(GatewayProvider::STRIPE, 'whsec_...');
$processor->registerHandler($stripeWebhookHandler);

$payload = $processor->process(
    providerName: 'stripe',
    payload: $rawPayload,
    headers: $request->headers->all(),
);
```
