# Payment Suite: Cross-Package Requirements Analysis

**Date:** December 18, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** ✅ Architectural Corrections Applied - Awaiting User Approval  
**Author:** Nexus Architecture Team

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive cross-package analysis of the 6 Payment packages created:

1. **Payment** (Core) - Foundation abstractions
2. **PaymentRails** - ACH, Wire, Check, RTGS, Virtual Cards
3. **PaymentGateway** - Stripe, PayPal, Square, Adyen
4. **PaymentBank** - Open Banking, Plaid, Account Verification
5. **PaymentWallet** - Apple Pay, Google Pay, BNPL
6. **PaymentRecurring** - Subscriptions, Usage Billing, Dunning

**Total Requirements Created:** 580 functional requirements + 51 non-functional requirements

> **Note (v1.1):** The core Payment package has been corrected to remove 3 requirements (PAY-052, PAY-053, PAY-054) that duplicated `Nexus\CashManagement` responsibility. See [PAYMENT_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md](PAYMENT_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md) for details.

---

## 2. Contradiction Analysis

### Result: **NO CONTRADICTIONS FOUND** ✅

Each package has clearly defined boundaries:

| Package | Payment Collection | Payment Disbursement | Tokenization | Recurring |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Payment (Core) | Abstractions only | Abstractions only | Interface only | N/A |
| PaymentRails | ACH Debit | ACH Credit, Wire, Check | N/A | N/A |
| PaymentGateway | Card charges | Refunds only | Yes (gateway-based) | N/A |
| PaymentBank | Open Banking PIS | Open Banking PIS | N/A | N/A |
| PaymentWallet | Wallet payments | N/A | Yes (wallet-based) | N/A |
| PaymentRecurring | Uses executors | Uses executors | N/A | Full lifecycle |

**No overlapping implementations** - each package handles distinct payment rails/methods.

---

## 3. Overlap Analysis

### 3.1 Identified Overlaps (Low Severity)

#### Overlap 1: Bank Account Validation
| Package | Requirement | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| PaymentRails | RAIL-060 to RAIL-065: Validates routing/account numbers | ✅ Validates format/checksum only |
| PaymentBank | BANK-020 to BANK-027: Account verification services | ✅ Verifies ownership via Plaid/micro-deposits |

**Clarification:** These are complementary, not overlapping:
- `PaymentRails` validates **format** (is this a valid routing number?)
- `PaymentBank` verifies **ownership** (does this person own this account?)

#### Overlap 2: Tokenization
| Package | Requirement | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| PaymentGateway | GW-030 to GW-036: Card tokenization via gateway | ✅ Gateway-specific tokens (Stripe, PayPal) |
| PaymentWallet | WALLET-010 to WALLET-025: Wallet payment tokens | ✅ Wallet-specific tokens (Apple Pay, Google Pay) |

**Clarification:** Token types are distinct:
- `PaymentGateway` handles **gateway tokens** (e.g., `pm_xxxxx` from Stripe)
- `PaymentWallet` handles **wallet tokens** (e.g., encrypted payment data from Apple Pay)

#### Overlap 3: Webhook Handling
| Package | Requirement | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| PaymentGateway | GW-060 to GW-067: Gateway webhooks | ✅ Stripe, PayPal, Square, Adyen webhooks |
| PaymentBank | BANK-016: Plaid webhooks | ✅ Plaid-specific webhooks |
| PaymentWallet | WALLET-066, WALLET-074, WALLET-093: BNPL webhooks | ✅ Klarna, Afterpay, Atome webhooks |

**Clarification:** Each package handles webhooks from its own providers. No shared webhook handling.

#### Overlap 4: Refund Processing
| Package | Requirement | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| PaymentGateway | GW-040 to GW-045: Card refunds | ✅ Refunds to original payment method |
| PaymentWallet | WALLET-065, WALLET-072, WALLET-082, WALLET-092: BNPL refunds | ✅ BNPL-specific refund flows |
| Payment (Core) | PAY-010: Payment reversal abstraction | ✅ Abstract interface only |

**Clarification:** 
- `Payment` defines the **interface** (`PaymentReversalInterface`)
- `PaymentGateway` implements **card refunds**
- `PaymentWallet` implements **BNPL refunds**

#### Overlap 5: Payment Status Tracking
| Package | Requirement | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Payment (Core) | PAY-011: PaymentStatus enum | ✅ Master status enum |
| PaymentGateway | GW-014: Authorization status | ✅ Gateway-specific sub-status |
| PaymentRecurring | REC-002: Subscription status | ✅ Subscription-specific status |

**Clarification:** 
- `Payment` core provides canonical `PaymentStatus` (PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED, etc.)
- Extensions track additional context-specific statuses

#### Overlap 6: Retry Logic
| Package | Requirement | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Payment (Core) | PAY-043: Payment execution retry | ✅ Abstract retry interface |
| PaymentGateway | GW-REL-002: Gateway retry with backoff | ✅ HTTP-level retry for gateway calls |
| PaymentRecurring | REC-100 to REC-104: Dunning retry strategies | ✅ Business-level retry for failed subscriptions |

**Clarification:**
- Core defines retry **interface**
- Gateway implements **technical** retry (HTTP failures)
- Recurring implements **business** retry (failed recurring payments)

#### Overlap 7: Multi-Currency
| Package | Requirement | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Payment (Core) | PAY-060 to PAY-063: Multi-currency support | ✅ Core Money VO usage |
| PaymentGateway | (Implicit) | ✅ Uses core Money VO |
| PaymentRecurring | (Implicit) | ✅ Uses core Money VO |

**Clarification:** All packages use `Nexus\Common\ValueObjects\Money` - no duplication.

---

## 4. Gap Analysis

### 4.1 Identified Gaps (Medium Severity)

#### Gap 1: Cross-Package Payment Orchestration
**Issue:** No clear requirement for orchestrating payments that span multiple packages (e.g., BNPL for a recurring subscription).

**Recommendation:** Add to `Payment` core:
```
PAY-078: System shall define PaymentOrchestratorInterface for cross-package coordination
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Consider for future orchestrator package (`PaymentOperations`)

---

#### Gap 2: Unified Payment Method Registry
**Issue:** Each extension defines its own payment methods, but there's no unified registry.

**Recommendation:** Add to `Payment` core:
```
PAY-079: System shall provide PaymentMethodRegistryInterface for method discovery
PAY-080: Extensions shall register payment methods with core registry
```

**Status:** ✅ ADDED to analysis recommendations

---

#### Gap 3: Processor Settlement Tracking for Extensions
**Issue:** `Payment` core defines processor settlement abstraction (PAY-050, PAY-051), but extensions don't explicitly reference implementation.

> **Note (v1.1):** PAY-052 to PAY-054 (reconciliation) have been **REMOVED** from Payment. Bank reconciliation is `Nexus\CashManagement`'s responsibility (BUS-CASH-0007 to BUS-CASH-0011).

**Recommendation:** Add to each extension:
- `PaymentRails`: ACH batch settlement tracking, wire confirmation status
- `PaymentGateway`: Stripe/PayPal/Adyen payout reports
- `PaymentBank`: Open Banking payment status confirmation

**Clarification:** "Processor settlement" means tracking when payment processors (Stripe, ACH network) group and settle transactions. This is distinct from "bank reconciliation" (matching settled transactions to bank statements), which is handled by `Nexus\CashManagement`.

**Status:** ⚠️ Extensions should implement `ProcessorSettlementInterface` from core

---

#### Gap 4: Fraud Detection Interface
**Issue:** Only `PaymentGateway` (GW-076) mentions fraud detection (Stripe Radar). Other packages should have hooks.

**Recommendation:** Add to `Payment` core:
```
PAY-081: System shall define FraudCheckInterface for pre-payment screening
PAY-082: Extensions may implement fraud check before payment execution
```

**Status:** ✅ ADDED to analysis recommendations

---

                               (Uses any executor)
```

**Dependency Rules:**
- ✅ All extensions depend on `nexus/payment ^0.1`
- ✅ `PaymentRecurring` depends on `nexus/payment` (for executors)
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ No cross-dependencies between extensions

---

## 6. Interface Alignment Check

### Core Interfaces Implemented by Extensions

| Core Interface | PaymentRails | PaymentGateway | PaymentBank | PaymentWallet | PaymentRecurring |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| `PaymentExecutorInterface` | ✅ ACH, Wire | ✅ Gateway | ✅ Open Banking | ✅ Wallet | Uses executors |
| `PaymentMethodInterface` | ✅ Bank Account | ✅ Card Token | ✅ Linked Account | ✅ Wallet Method | N/A |
| `DisbursementInterface` | ✅ ACH Credit | ✅ Refund only | ✅ PIS | N/A | N/A |
| `ProcessorSettlementInterface` | 📝 To implement | 📝 To implement | 📝 To implement | 📝 To implement | N/A |

> **Note (v1.1):** `ReconciliationInterface` has been **REMOVED** from Payment. Bank reconciliation is handled by `Nexus\CashManagement`. Payment packages provide transaction data that CashManagement matches against bank statements.

---

## 7. Event Alignment Check

### Unified Event Naming Convention ✅

| Event Type | Payment | Rails | Gateway | Bank | Wallet | Recurring |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| Created | ✅ PaymentCreatedEvent | ✅ AchBatchCreatedEvent | - | - | - | ✅ SubscriptionCreatedEvent |
| Processing | ✅ PaymentProcessingEvent | - | ✅ PaymentAuthorizedEvent | - | ✅ WalletPaymentInitiatedEvent | - |
| Completed | ✅ PaymentCompletedEvent | ✅ AchFileGeneratedEvent | ✅ PaymentCapturedEvent | ✅ PaymentConfirmedEvent | ✅ WalletPaymentCompletedEvent | ✅ SubscriptionRenewedEvent |
| Failed | ✅ PaymentFailedEvent | ✅ AchReturnReceivedEvent | ✅ GatewayErrorEvent | ✅ VerificationFailedEvent | ✅ WalletPaymentFailedEvent | ✅ PaymentFailedEvent |
| Refunded | ✅ PaymentReversedEvent | - | ✅ PaymentRefundedEvent | - | ✅ WalletRefundedEvent | - |

All events follow consistent naming: `{Entity}{Action}Event`

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Immediate Actions (Before Development)

1. **Add Missing Core Requirements:**
   - `PAY-078`: PaymentOrchestratorInterface
   - `PAY-079`: PaymentMethodRegistryInterface
   - `PAY-080`: Method registration from extensions
   - `PAY-081`: FraudCheckInterface
   - `PAY-082`: Fraud check hook

2. **Add Settlement Implementation Requirements:**
   - Each extension should implement `SettlementProviderInterface`

### 8.2 Future Considerations

1. **Create `PaymentOperations` Orchestrator:**
   - Coordinate complex payment flows across packages
   - Handle subscription + BNPL scenarios
   - Provide unified payment status tracking

2. **Consider Regional Payment Extensions:**
   - `PaymentMalaysia` - FPX, DuitNow, Touch 'n Go specifics
   - `PaymentSingapore` - PayNow, NETS
   - `PaymentIndia` - UPI, RuPay
